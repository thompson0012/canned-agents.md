# PRD.md — Product Requirements Document

> **TEMPLATE**: The requirements, personas, and features below are illustrative examples only. Replace with actual product requirements before use.

**Purpose**: This document serves as the single source of truth for the product's vision, goals, and requirements. It should be used to align all stakeholders and guide the technical implementation.

## Overview

**Purpose**: A high-level summary of the product's core value proposition and target audience.

**Example**:
A secure, real-time collaboration platform for distributed engineering teams that integrates with existing version control systems and provides automated project health insights.

## Goals & Success Metrics

**Purpose**: Define measurable outcomes that determine the product's success.

**Example**:
- **Goal**: Achieve sub-200ms API response time for all core endpoints.
- **KPI**: 95th percentile latency remains below 200ms under 100 concurrent users.
- **Goal**: Ensure high accessibility compliance.
- **KPI**: Zero critical violations in WCAG 2.1 AA audits.

## User Personas

**Purpose**: Describe the primary users and their specific needs or pain points.

**Example**:
1. **Senior Developer**: Needs automated tools to reduce manual code review time and ensure consistency across the team.
2. **Project Manager**: Requires clear visibility into project progress and potential blockers without needing to read code.

## Features & Requirements

### Must-Have
**Purpose**: Non-negotiable features required for a minimum viable product (MVP).

**Example**:
- User authentication and authorization.
- Real-time message broadcasting via WebSockets.

### Should-Have
**Purpose**: Important features that add significant value but are not critical for the initial launch.

**Example**:
- Automated daily activity summaries.
- Search functionality across historical messages.

### Could-Have
**Purpose**: "Nice to have" features that can be implemented if time and resources permit.

**Example**:
- Custom theme support for the user interface.
- Integration with third-party calendar services.

### Won't-Have (for now)
**Purpose**: Features explicitly excluded from the current scope to prevent scope creep.

**Example**:
- Native mobile applications (initial focus is web-only).
- Support for on-premise deployments.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Purpose**: Constraints on the system's operation, such as performance, security, and accessibility.

**Example**:
- **Performance**: The system should support up to 1,000 concurrent WebSocket connections.
- **Security**: All data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256.
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Purpose**: Explicitly state any assumptions made during planning and identify potential risks.

**Example**:
- **Assumption**: Users have a stable internet connection for real-time features.
- **Risk**: Potential latency issues if the chosen WebSocket provider experiences downtime.

## Out of Scope

**Purpose**: Clearly define what the product will NOT do to maintain focus.

**Example**:
- Direct billing or payment processing (handled by a separate service).
- Comprehensive project management features (focus is on collaboration).
