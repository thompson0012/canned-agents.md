# TECH_STACK.md — Approved Technology Stack

**Purpose**: This document tracks the versions and tools approved for use in the project. 

**Discipline**: Adhere to an "unknown until confirmed" policy. Do not assume the existence of tools or libraries unless they are explicitly listed here.

## Frontend

**Guidance**: Focus on accessibility, performance (TTI, bundle size), and clean code patterns.

- Framework: (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) — *Unknown until confirmed*
- Styling: (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components)
- State Management: (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Context API)

## Backend

**Guidance**: Prioritize security, scalability, and maintainable API patterns.

- Runtime: (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go) — *Unknown until confirmed*
- Framework: (e.g., Express, FastAPI, NestJS)
- Authentication: (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, Session-based)

## Database / Infrastructure

- Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Hosting: (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Railway)
- ORM/Client: (e.g., Prisma, Mongoose, Kysely)

## Dev Tools

- Linter: (e.g., ESLint, Biome)
- Formatter: (e.g., Prettier)
- Test Runner: (e.g., Vitest, Jest, Pytest)
- Documentation: (e.g., TSDoc, JSDoc)

## Prohibited / Deprecated

**Guidance**: Avoid these tools to prevent technical debt or security vulnerabilities.

- (Example): Libraries with known critical vulnerabilities or those that have been officially deprecated.
- (Example): Tools that do not align with the project's performance or accessibility goals.
