# PROGRESS.md — Session & Project State Log

> **TEMPLATE**: The session entries below are illustrative examples only. Replace with actual session logs before use.

> **EXAMPLE ASSUMPTIONS**: The entries below reference specific technologies (React, Argon2, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis) as examples.
> Replace with your actual stack and real session history; keep the structure (Completed / In Progress / Blockers / Notes) the same.

**Purpose**: This document provides a lightweight way to track progress and carry state between sessions. It should be updated at the end of every session.

## Session Summary: February 7, 2026

**Focus**: Foundation - Authentication Implementation

**Active Plan (optional)**:
- Link: /docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_short-title/

## Completed This Session

- [x] Initialized project repository with basic folder structure.
- [x] Implemented `POST /auth/register` endpoint with password hashing.
- [x] Added unit tests for user registration flow.
- [x] Verified database schema for `users` table.

## Still In Progress / Next Up

- [ ] Implement `POST /auth/login` and JWT generation.
- [ ] Create basic React login form and integrate with the API.
- [ ] Implement logout functionality.

## Blockers / Open Questions

- **Blocker**: Waiting for finalized security requirements regarding password complexity rules.
- **Question**: Should we support social login (OAuth) in the initial MVP?

## Quick Notes / Metrics

- **API Performance**: Registration endpoint averages 150ms latency.
- **Test Coverage**: Current coverage is 85% for the authentication module.
- **Decision**: Decided to use Argon2 for password hashing over bcrypt for better security.
