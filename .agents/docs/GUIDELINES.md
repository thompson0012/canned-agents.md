# GUIDELINES.md — How to Write & Maintain Project Documentation

> **STATUS**: TEMPLATE
> **OWNER**: Human (final authority) / AI (maintenance)
> **LAST REVIEWED**: 2026-02-12

**Purpose**: This document provides supporting guidance for AI agents on how to create, update, and structure the key documents referenced in `AGENTS.md`. 

*Note: This is a supporting guide. Canonical rules reside in `AGENTS.md`.*

## Status Header (Required)
Every doc must include a STATUS header:

> **STATUS**: TEMPLATE | PRODUCTION | EXAMPLES-ONLY
> **OWNER**: Human (final authority) / AI (maintenance)
> **LAST REVIEWED**: <YYYY-MM-DD or Unknown>

Status meanings:
- TEMPLATE: generic template, not project-specific
- PRODUCTION: validated and updated after Template-to-Production Rule
- EXAMPLES-ONLY: fictional examples; delete before real use

**Status-Driven Behavior Rules**
- Only `STATUS: PRODUCTION` docs are authoritative.
- `STATUS: TEMPLATE` or `STATUS: EXAMPLES-ONLY` may be read for context only; decisions MUST NOT rely on them.
- Before first coding, confirm core docs are `STATUS: PRODUCTION`: PRD, TECH_STACK, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, SECURITY, TEST_STRATEGY.

## General Principles

- **Conciseness**: Documents MUST be concise yet complete, prioritizing clarity over length.
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown with semantic headings (`##`, `###`), bullet lists, and tables to improve readability.
- **Version Control**: Changes MUST be committed with descriptive, atomic messages.
- **Traceability**: Statements MUST be grounded in the codebase, requirements, or recorded decisions.
- **Approval**: Major updates to any document MUST be proposed to the user for explicit approval before implementation when AUTO-PILOT is off.
- **Session Mode**: Read `SESSION_MODE` from `/.agents/docs/PROGRESS.md` (STANDARD | AUTO-PILOT). Default STANDARD if missing. AUTO-PILOT allows autonomous plan/research/execute for the current session.
- **Iteration**: Documents should be updated as new insights or corrections occur. **Self‑maintenance**: `AGENTS.md` and `/.agents/docs/*` are agent‑maintained artifacts; the agent must keep them current and aligned with user conversations and decisions, using the Doc Evolution Protocol.

## Template Filling Protocol (for AI agents)

When asked to fill any template:
1. **Evidence first**: derive content from the repo, PRD/TECH_STACK, tickets, or explicit user input—avoid invention.
2. **Assumptions**: if you infer anything, add an `ASSUMPTIONS` block and make it easy to correct.
3. **Unknowns stay unknown**: keep “Unknown until confirmed” where facts are missing.
4. **Examples are labeled**: wrap sample content under **“## Example (fictional, delete before use)”**.
5. **Human override**: treat human edits as authoritative and update surrounding docs accordingly.
6. **Placeholders**: use `<...>` or `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` until real values exist.

## Version Control Workflow

Guidance for maintaining a clean and traceable project history:

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit MUST represent a single, logical change.
- **Message Format**: Prefer `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login form validation`).
- **PR Hygiene**: Pull requests MUST include a clear summary of changes and reference relevant tasks or issues.

## Document-Specific Guidance

### PROGRESS.md (Session State Log)
- **Purpose**: Lightweight state carry-over between sessions.
- **Structure Recommendation**:
  - Session summary and date at the top.
  - Sections for Completed, In Progress, Blockers, and Quick Notes.
- **Example**: "Finished API integration for user profiles; blocking on database migration script."

### PRD.md (Product Requirements, Plan & Tasks)
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for requirements, implementation plan, and tasks.
- **Structure Recommendation**: Overview, Goals/Metrics, Personas, Features (MoSCoW), Non-Functional Requirements, User Journeys & Edge Cases, Flow Diagrams (optional), Implementation Plan, Task Board.
- **Example Goal**: "Reduce page load time by 30% to improve user retention."

### TECH_STACK.md
- **Purpose**: Documentation of versions and allowed tools, including security and test strategy.
- **Discipline**: Use an "unknown until confirmed" approach for any tech stack assumptions.

### LESSONS.md (Operational Patterns)
- **Purpose**: Log of learned optimizations and avoided mistakes.
- **Structure Recommendation**: Issue description, Root cause, and a pattern to prevent recurrence.
- **Example**: "Avoided using global state for temporary form data; used local component state instead."

### PROGRESS.md
- **Purpose**: Session log plus consolidated changelog.
- **Structure Recommendation**: Session summary, completed/in‑progress/blockers, rollups, and changelog entries.

## Document Minimum Sections (Best-Practice Baseline)
Before a doc is considered “ready,” ensure these sections exist:

**PRD.md**
- Goals & success metrics
- Personas / users
- MoSCoW features
- Non-functional requirements
- Out of scope
- User journeys & edge cases
- Flow diagrams (optional)
- Implementation plan (milestones, phases, risks)
- Task board (atomic tasks + statuses)

**TECH_STACK.md**
- Tool list with versions
- Runtime constraints
- Prohibited/deprecated items
- Security guidance
- Test strategy
- “Locked as of” date

**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
- Milestones + verification
- Dependencies & blockers
- Risks & mitigations
- Rollback/stop conditions

**PROGRESS.md**
- Session summary
- Completed / In Progress / Blockers
- Rollup (weekly/monthly, optional)
- Changelog (Added / Changed / Fixed)

**FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md**
- UI tokens
- Components
- Motion & accessibility

## Communication Standards

### Before Starting Work (RECOMMENDED)
```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
- [Assumption 1 - let user correct before wasted work]
- [Assumption 2]
```

### Plan Template (RECOMMENDED)
Use this format when proposing a plan (especially for anything > 20 lines or > 1 file per `AGENTS.md` §4).

```
PLAN:
- Goal:
- Scope (in):
- Non-goals (out):
- Constraints (tools, time, compatibility, risk tier):
- Assumptions (explicit; link to PRD/TECH_STACK where relevant):
- Risks / unknowns:

TASK BREAKDOWN (atomic, verifiable):
- Task 1:
  - Files/areas:
  - Success criteria:
  - Verification (tests/build/lsp/manual):
  - Dependencies/blockers:
- Task 2:
  - ...

ROLLBACK / STOP CONDITIONS:
- If [X] fails, do [Y] (revert, pause, escalate, ask for approval).
```

### Plan & Task Recordkeeping (RECOMMENDED)

If you want plans and task breakdowns to remain traceable across sessions, use the conventions in `.agents/docs/PLANS.md`.

Recommended approach:
- Keep the approved plan in a dated folder under `/.agents/docs/plans/.../plan.md`
- Keep the plan’s atomic checklist in `/.agents/docs/plans/.../tasks.md`
- Link to the plan folder from `.agents/docs/PROGRESS.md` (session timeline)
- Avoid duplicating the same checklist in multiple places; prefer linking

### After Completing Work (RECOMMENDED)
```
CHANGES MADE:
- [file/location]: [what changed and why]
```

### Proposing Documentation Updates
When updating any document (per AGENTS.md §5):
1. Analyze current state and identify necessary changes
2. Propose using `PROPOSED DOC UPDATE` format (see AGENTS.md §5)
3. Wait for explicit user approval (or `SUPER-APPROVED(PLAN+DOC)` / `SUPER-APPROVED(ALL)` if provided; `SUPER-APPROVED(NULL)` resets to standard)
4. Update and log summary in PROGRESS.md

#### When to Update Docs (Trigger Checklist)
Update docs when any of the following occur:
- **User feedback / clarified goals** → update AGENTS.md + canonical docs (Template-to-Production Rule).
- **User correction** (wrong pattern / hallucination / bad decision) → add rule in AGENTS.md or LESSONS.md.
- **Plan includes doc changes** → batch doc updates with plan approval.
- **Code changes completed** → update PROGRESS.md and (if applicable) LESSONS.md.
- **Doc map drift** → sync Doc Map with actual `/.agents/docs/` contents.

## Writing Conventions

- Use active voice and professional tone.
- Avoid jargon unless it is part of the project's domain glossary.
- Prefer tables for comparing options or listing tokens.
- Keep examples practical and easy to follow.

This document may be updated by following `AGENTS.md` §5 (Documentation Evolution Protocol).
