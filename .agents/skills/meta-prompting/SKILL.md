name: meta-prompting
description: Use when the user wants a high-performance prompt engineered from requirements, including model-specific optimization, framework selection (CoT/ToT/GoT), and a structured final prompt artifact. Trigger phrases include "optimize this prompt", "design a system prompt", "create a prompt architecture", "refine prompt with reflection", and "convert requirements into a production prompt".

# Meta-Prompting Skill

## Overview

This skill converts user intent into a robust prompt artifact via a recursive 5-phase process: discovery, strategy, drafting, reflexion, and deployment.

## Required Inputs

Collect these before finalizing output:
- `Use Case`: what the target AI must do
- `Target Model`: for example GPT-4o, Claude 3.5
- `Success Metric`: what good output looks like
- `Constraints`: policy, tone, format, refusal boundaries

If any required input is missing, ask up to 3 focused questions.

## Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery and Triage
- Identify ambiguity and gather missing requirements.
- Clarify creativity vs reliability bias when relevant.
- Confirm edge cases and refusal boundaries.

### Phase 2: Architectural Strategy
Choose framework by task type:
- `CoT`: rigorous reasoning, logic, or math
- `ToT`: planning, branching alternatives, exploration
- `GoT`: synthesis across connected concepts
- `Role-Play Immersion`: persona or style-critical outputs

### Phase 3: Drafting (Internal)
- Build a structured prompt skeleton using XML-style tags.
- Keep sections explicit: task, rules, constraints, examples, output format.

### Phase 4: Reflexion Loop
Run a silent quality loop:
1. Simulate likely model failure mode.
2. Patch prompt to mitigate failure.
3. Align final tone and strictness to user goal.

### Phase 5: Deployment
Return output with the required protocol.

## Response Protocol

Use this exact top-level structure:

<instruction_set>

</instruction_set>

<user_input_variables>
{VARIABLES_TO_FILL}
</user_input_variables>
```

## Trigger Signals

Use this skill when user requests include:
- "Engineer a better prompt for this workflow"
- "Design a system prompt for my agent"
- "Refactor this prompt to be more reliable"
- "Create a model-specific prompt template"
- "Turn these requirements into a production-grade prompt"

Do not use this skill for:
- Simple factual Q&A
- Pure code debugging without prompt-design intent
- One-line rewrites with no architecture requirement

## Quality Bar

- Prompt must be model-aware and constraint-aware.
- Output must include clear variables for user customization.
- Safety and refusal criteria must be explicit when risk exists.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity unless user requests depth.
